# notesy app
## day 1
Notesy is an app that allows you to add a note using the command line using --add (or -a for short) followed by 'a message in single' -a "or double quotation marks".
To use this app you must first install "minimist" by entering "npm -i minimist" into the command line.
You can test the app by navigating to the folder that holds the repository and there, after installing the dependencies, you can enter "node . -a "and a message you'd like to add"
followed by ENTER to submit. 
You should then see what you have typed printed in the CLI. 

## day 2
This was a tough day.. I would have been easier to start from scratch than to untie and tie as many lines of code as I did to get these tests to pass. 

## day 3 and 4
I spent most of Day 3 and 4 getting this app to pass lab 3 standards hustling to submit something by the midnight due date. 

## day 5
BUT then I finally got to finish lab 4 on day 5! 
a huge 'ah ha' moment came to me today when Cait was helping me. I had thought that the .delete() and .get() functions were built in methods to mongoDB but didn't realize until today that I was calling those functions through the require(filepath) sort of tethering!
